The need to rapidly digitise millions of specimens in Natural History Collections has necessitated a staged approach for data capture. The Minimum Information about a Digital Specimen (MIDS) specification (https://github.com/tdwg/mids) has been designed to provide a means of measuring and monitoring the level of digitisation of specimens within a collection. It also provides guidance for prioritising the data to be captured as well as recommendations for data standards and mapping structures.
