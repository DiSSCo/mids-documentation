  3. "display_comments"

	Type of data:          Text
	Contains null values:  False
	Non-null values:       25

	Most common values:    A physical address for an organisational unit or person. (1x)
	                       The age of a specimen or related materials that is generated from a dating assay. To represent a single age, enter the same value in both earliestChronometricAge and latestChronometricAge. Leaving one or both of these fields blank indicates that the value is unknown, has yet to be recorded or is not applicable to the material being described. We recommend that you do not use this class to indicate chronostratigraphy: it is intended to be used to reflect a chronometric age or range of ages determined via one or more named analytical protocols, methods or techniques. (1x)
	                       A record of current and past statuses of the object group and the reason for status changes. Use this class to record the history of and reason for changes in the status of the described collection. Types of status described by this class may, for example, include ownership, management, accessibility or accrual policy over time. Dates reflecting the start and end of the status described by this class should be recorded using an instance of TemporalCoverage. If temporalCoverageEndDateTime is empty, the status should be inferred to be the current status of the collection. (1x)
	                       Details of a method by which an entity such as a Person or OrganisationalUnit may be contacted. The Address class should be used to store physical or postal addresses. For all other types of contact details, this class should be used. (1x)
	                       The ecological and/or biogeographic classification of the region from which objects associated with the ObjectGroup were collected, or where an Event took place. There is some conceptual overlap with the GeographicContext class with respect to geographic locations. This class should be used for biogeographic and ecological concepts, whereas for physical, political and administrative geographic locations, the GeographicContext class is more appropriate. Specific information about the habitat and ecological conditions that applied at the time that an event took place should be recorded in the `habitat` property of the Event class. (1x)
